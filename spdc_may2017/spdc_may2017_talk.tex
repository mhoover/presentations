    \frametitle{Let's start small: The individual}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> The individual plays the key role in most econometric analyses
        \item<1-> However, misses relational information between people
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<1-> Relations can guide actions or behaviors (\textit{influence})
            \item<1-> Actions can determine relations (\textit{selection})
        \end{itemize}
        \item<1-> In networks, an individual is called a \textbf{node}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<1-> Terminology borrowed from graph theory, as another representation of a network is a graph
            \item<1-> Each node can have a series of attributes: age, gender, beliefs, career
            \item<1-> Note, networks do not have to be of people only

	\frametitle{A simple question: What is a network?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> `I know it when I see it': Simply put, it's a collection of entities (nodes) connected in some way (edges)
        \item<1-> That collection of entities -- depending on how they are connected -- do or do not make a network\ldots moreover, depending on the connection type, it forms different networks
        \item<2-> The size of a network can differ dramatically; for example\ldots
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<2-> Friendship ties of high schoolers \textit{in real life}
            \item<2-> Friendship ties of high schoolers \textit{on Instagram}
        \end{itemize}
        \item<3-> The type of network can differ too\ldots
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<3-> A \textit{one-mode} network is of a single entity type, e.g., dogs connected to other dogs through breeding
            \item<3-> A \textit{two-mode} network is of two separate entities, e.g., people connected to beers they drank
            \item<3-> A two-mode network can be `flattened` to create a person-to-person or beer-to-beer network
        \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}
        \item<2-> Finally, the scope of the network can differ
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<2-> A \textit{complete} network looks at the whole network, e.g., doctors' referrals to other doctors in a hospital
            \item<2-> A \textit{personal} or \textit{ego-centric} network focuses on the constellation of nodes around an entity in particular, e.g., whom jazz musicians have sessioned with in the past
            \item<2-> Both networks have their advantages and disadvantages

\frame {
	\frametitle{The seeds of a network: Dyads and triads}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> The start of a network is the connection of two nodes through a edge: A \textit{dyad}
		\item<1-> This already adds complexity -- is the network \textit{undirected} or \textit{directed}?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<2-> An undirected network means there is no directionality in the tie -- the tie is the same for both nodes, e.g., two servers that are connected to one another
            \item<2-> A directed network means ties have a sender and a receiver and the connection flows one-way only, e.g., followers on Twitter
            \item<2-> Of course, in a directed network and edge can be bi-directional, which is generally seen as a `stronger` tie than a uni-directional connection
        \end{itemize}
        \item<3-> A core building block in networks are \textit{triads} or the grouping of three nodes together in some way.
    \end{itemize}
}

% 4b
\frame {
    \frametitle{The seeds of a network: Dyads and triads}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> A triad, even though only three nodes, is already an interesting structure. It can exhibit hierarchy, closeness, or little relation between nodes
        \item<1-> With many nodes in a network, one technique to use is a \textit{triad count}, which countes the number of triads for the various possible formations
        \item<1-> Triads, depending on how they are formed and interconnect, help to determine the more advanced structure of a network, including cliques and sub-graphs
        \item<2-> An outgrowth of triads are \textit{isolates}, which are nodes in a network that are not connected to any other node
        \item<2-> Isolates often exhibit unique behavior or have attributes that differ from others within the network
        \item<2-> A network itself can be composed of many isolates, which is also interesting -- depending on the purpose of the network, this could be expected or potentially problematic
    \end{itemize}
}

% 5a
\frame {
	\frametitle{The total network}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> From triads, the network builds into more complex structures that can be broken down to isolates, dyads, and triads, but is much, much more
        \item<1-> At this point, network measures and statistics become important
        \item<1-> The most basic is \textit{density}, a measure on the network itself -- of all possible connections, how many are present?
        \item<1-> At the node level, there are measures of \textit{centrality}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<1-> \textit{Degree} (\textit{in-degree} and \textit{out-degree} for directed networks): The number of ties for each node in a network; in-degree\slash out-degree centrality can be called popularity and activity, respectively
            \item<1-> \textit{Betweenness}: A measure of position of a person -- do they sit `between' others or not; nodes will high betweenness centrality are `bridges' to other parts of the network
            \item<1-> \textit{Eigenvector}: Measures the connections' connections, that is, nodes have higher values if their connections are well-connected and those connections are well-connected and so on
        \end{itemize}
		\item<1-> Let's take a minute or two to look at a network and then take a look at some of these network summary measures

            \item<1-> What about betweenness centrality? Why?

        \item<1-> Let's pause for a second: So these measures may be \textit{interesting}, but what can be done with them beyond descriptive statistics?
        \item<1-> There needs to be a way to relate network summaries -- and the statistics we will discuss next -- to the individual
        \item<1-> There are two choices in particular:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<2-> The first is using node-level summaries as individual-level measures
            \item<2-> These measures can be used as covariates in modeling efforts (remember to normalize!)
            \item<3-> Second, if there are individuals from multiple networks, then think about a hierarchical model, if the outcome is amenable
            \item<3-> Works well for analyses utilizing personal networks or similar complete networks measured at the same time
        \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Moving from descriptives: Identifying structure in a network}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Beyond network descriptive statistics and visualizations, we can use algorithms to determine underlying structure in networks
        \item<1-> The value of structure is it helps to sub-divide a network into smaller, (more) cohesive groups
        \item<2-> Some examples of community structure:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<2-> Clients and personal relationships in commercial sex workers' lives
            \item<2-> Grade levels within a high school
            \item<2-> Political affiliation within Twitter
        \end{itemize}

% 6b
\frame {
    \frametitle{Community detection algorithms}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Many variations; one of the more well-known algorithms is Girvan-Newman, which is a hierarchical method for detecting community structure
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item<1-> Calculate betweenness
            \item<1-> Remove edge with highest betweenness
            \item<1-> Repeat 1 and 2 until no edges are left
        \end{enumerate}
        \item<1-> Other algorithms exist, utilizing different rules for structuring
        \item<1-> Some will only work with undirected networks
        \item<1-> A community detection algorithm is not \textit{the answer} it is \textit{an answer} to help better understand what's happening in a network.

    \frametitle{Building networks}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> It is expensive and time-consuming to collect network data
        \item<1-> However, building a network doesn't need too difficult; with API access and some code, network construction is certainly possible
        \item<1-> Most APIs will provide some information on users (nodes) and based on the site, there are probably ways to identify connections (edges)
        \item<1-> Depending on the edges, this may create a one- or two-mode network
        \item<1-> Examples of one-mode connections:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<1-> Twitter followers (one-mode)
            \item<1-> Friends on Instagram (one-mode)
            \item<1-> Hashtags used in tweets (two-mode)
            \item<1-> \textit{Beers checked-in on Untappd} (two-mode)
        \end{itemize}
        \item<1-> Let's take a look at building a one-mode network by collecting data from an API on a two-mode network and figure out some interesting things along the way

\frame {
    \frametitle{Creating a network from Untappd}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> \href{https://untappd.com/}{Untappd} is a mobile app that allows people to track the beers that they have or are drinking
        \item<1-> Its API provides access to user details as well as the beers that users check in (along with other information that we'll ignore for this exercise)
        \item<1-> So let's say I am interested to know not just \textit{who} my friends are (which I already have due to friend connections), but \textit{which of my friends have similar beer preferences}
        \item<1-> We could:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<1-> Pull all the beers I have checked-in along will all of my friends
            \item<1-> For each friend, grab all the beers they've checked-in
            \item<1-> Create an edgelist of person-to-beer
            \item<1-> `Flatten' the two-mode network to a one-mode person-to-person (or, beer-to-beer) network, where the edges are the number of beers in common two nodes have checked in
        \end{itemize}
