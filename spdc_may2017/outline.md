# Social Networks: A Fast Tour From People to Groups!

## Introduction
This talk was for the [Statistical Programmaing DC](https://www.meetup.com/stats-prog-dc/) meetup group, part of [Data Community DC](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/), given on 02 May 2017. It focuses on social networks; more specifically, the construction of networks, analyses of networks, and how they can be influence and enhance one's work. The presentation was a mix of easily accessible theory and practice and uses both [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) for demonstrations.

## Outline of the Talk
1. Introduction
    * Background
    * Outline talk
2. Individuals
    * Basic unit of analysis for econometrics or ML
    * Miss relational information
    * What that provides
3. What is a network
    * Network creation
    * Snapshot in time
    * Varies based on tie
        * Face-to-face network
        * Online network
    * One- and two-mode
    * Complete versus personal
    * Introduce:
        * Node
        * Edge
4. Basic network
    * Dyad
    * Introduce:
        * Degree
        * Direction
    * Triad
    * Introduce:
        * Triad count
        * Isolates
5. Larger network
    * More than a triad
    * Introduce:
        * Centrality
        * Sub-graphs
    * How to relate to individual analyses
        * Summaries
        * Hierarchies
6. Community structure
    * Network position
    * What does this add to analyses
    * Introduce:
        * Block model
        * Community structure
7. Network modeling
    * Using network as the basis, not an individual
    * Introduce:
        * ERGM
        * SAOM
8. Visualization
    * Provide a 'summary view' on the network
    * Helpful for qualitative analysis on its own
    * Helps contextualize quantitative results
9. Building your own network
    * Wealth of ability to build your own networks for analysis
    * Most APIs will provide users; ties generated by data type
    * Twitter; ties could be..
        * Re-tweets
        * Likes
        * Followers
        * Time of tweet
        * Topic
    * Untappd; ties could be...
        * Same beer checked-in
        * Location
        * Friends
        * Badges
        * Use of language

## To-do's
* Add in code at each point (update outline!)
* Draft slides/talking points
* Create/identify visuals
