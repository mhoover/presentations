# Presentations
## Introduction
This repo contains talks I've given in public. There's not much here because I don't speak often. :)

## Talks
1. **[iHub Research](https://ihub.co.ke/research) meetup**
Date: 11 Jul 2014
Location: Nairobi, Kenya

See `ihub_jul2014`

This talk was for the [iHub Research Group](https://ihub.co.ke/research) on network visualization in R, given on 11 Jul 2014. It focused on a self-written R package, `ggnet` that I developed while writing my dissertation as I wanted something prettier than the basic graphics package for plotting in R. The talk focused on why I did this and the features it provides.

2. **[Statistical Programmaing DC](https://www.meetup.com/stats-prog-dc/) meetup**
Date: 02 May 2017
Location: Washington, DC

See `spdc_may2017`

This talk was for the [Statistical Programmaing DC](https://www.meetup.com/stats-prog-dc/) meetup group, part of [Data Community DC](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/), given on 02 May 2017. It focused on social networks; more specifically, the construction of networks, analyses of networks, and how they can be influence and enhance one's work. The presentation was a mix of easily accessible theory and practice and uses both [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) for demonstrations.
