## Introduction
This repo contains talks I've given in public. There's not much here because I don't speak often. :)

## Talks
1. **[Statistical Programmaing DC](https://www.meetup.com/stats-prog-dc/) meetup, 02 May 2017**

See `spdc_may2017`

This talk was for the [Statistical Programmaing DC](https://www.meetup.com/stats-prog-dc/) meetup group, part of [Data Community DC](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/), given on 02 May 2017. It focuses on social networks; more specifically, the construction of networks, analyses of networks, and how they can be influence and enhance one's work. The presentation was a mix of easily accessible theory and practice and uses both [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) for demonstrations.
